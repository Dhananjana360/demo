        <p align="justify"><font color="white" size="4">A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby obscuring the view of the Sun from a small part of Earth, totally or partially. Such an alignment occurs approximately every six months, during the eclipse season in its new moon phase, when the Moon's orbital plane is closest to the plane of Earth's orbit.In a total eclipse, the disk of the Sun is fully obscured by the Moon. In partial and annular eclipses, only part of the Sun is obscured. Unlike a lunar eclipse, which may be viewed from anywhere on the night side of Earth, a solar eclipse can only be viewed from a relatively small area of the world. As such, although total solar eclipses occur somewhere on Earth every 18 months on average, they recur at any given place only once every 360 to 410 years.These are not safe to view with naked eyes,so it's safe to watch it with  proper eye protection and special precautions.

        <h3><font color="yellow" face="Times new Roman">There are three main types of solar eclipses:</font></h3>

                    <dd>A total eclipse occurs when the dark shadow of the Moon completely obscures the bright light of the Sun, allowing the much fainter solar corona to be visible. During an eclipse, totality occurs only along a narrow track on the surface of Earth.</dd>
                </dl></li>
            <li>
                <dl>
                    <dt><b><font color="#AD7C63">Annular Eclipse</font></b></dt>
                    <dd>An annular eclipse, like a total eclipse, occurs when the Sun and Moon are exactly in line with Earth. During an annular eclipse, however, the apparent size of the Moon is not large enough to completely block out the Sun.Totality thus does not occur; the Sun instead appears as a very bright ring, or annulus, surrounding the dark disk of the Moon.Annular eclipses occur once every one or two years, not annually</dd>
                </dl></li>
            <li>
                <dl>
                    <dt><b><font color="#AD7C63">Partial Eclipse</font></b></dt>
                    <dd>A partial eclipse occurs when the Sun and Moon are not exactly in line with Earth and the Moon only partially obscures the Sun. This phenomenon can usually be seen from a large part of Earth outside of the track of an annular or total eclipse. However, some eclipses can be seen only as a partial eclipse, because the umbra passes above Earth's polar regions and never intersects Earth's surface.These can be virtually unnoticable.</dd>

        <p><font color="white" size="4"><img src="./ECLIPSE/Eclipse Solar Eclipse GIF - Eclipse Solar Eclipse Sun - Discover & Share GIFs.gif" width="75px" align="bottom">The relative distance of the Moon from Earth at the time of an eclipse can affect the eclipse's duration. In particular, when the Moon is near apogee, the farthest point from Earth in its orbit, its orbital speed is the slowest. The diameter of Earth's umbra does not decrease appreciably within the changes in the Moon's orbital distance. Thus, the concurrence of a totally eclipsed Moon near apogee will lengthen the duration of totality.</font></p>

        <p><font color="white" size="4">Although there are at least two solar eclipses each year, somewhere on earth, they are however rare in any particular location, since the path of shadow is narrow. Over the 600 year period from 1500 to 2100 AD, it has been computed that 3 Total Solar Eclipses and 11 Annular Solar Eclipse paths cross Lanka. However from any one location in Lanka, only 1 Total and 4 or 5 Annular Eclipses.
