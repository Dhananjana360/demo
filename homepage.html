        <p><font color="#B3B3B3" size="5">An eclipse is an astronomical event which occurs when an astronomical  <br>objector spacecraft is temporarily obscured, by passing into <br> the shadow of another body or by having another body pass<br> between it and the viewer.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#B3B3B3" size="5">The term eclipse is most often used to describe either a solar <br>eclipse, when the Moon's shadow crosses the Earth's surface,<br> or a lunar eclipse, when the Moon moves into the Earth's <br>shadow.For the special cases of solar and lunar eclipses,<br> these only happen during an "eclipse season", the two <br>     times of each year when the plane of the Earth's orbit <br>around the Sun crosses with the plane of the Moon's <br> orbit around the Earth and the line defined by the <br> intersecting planes points near the Sun.To see a <br>total solar eclipse, an observer must be within the <br> umbra. Observers in the penumbra will witness a <br>partial eclipse, with only part of the Sun covered by <br>the Moon. Those outside the Moon's shadow will see no <br> eclipse at all.That's because The Moon's shadow on Earth <br>isn't very big, so only a small portion of places on Earth <br>will see it.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#B3B3B3" size="5">Lunar eclipses can be viewed from the entire nightside half <br>of the Earth. But solar eclipses, particularly total eclipses <br>occurring at any one particular point on the Earth's surface,<br> are very rare events that can be many decades apart.</p>
